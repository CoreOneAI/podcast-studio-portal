# Netlify Configuration File

# 1. Build Settings (adjust if using CRA or Vite - assuming 'dist' for Vite build output)
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist" # Change this to "build" if using Create React App

# 2. Netlify Functions Configuration
# This tells Netlify where to find and build your serverless functions.
[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  # Set the environment variable here for the functions, though setting it in the Netlify UI is more secure
  # environment = { GEMINI_API_KEY = "value_goes_in_netlify_ui" }


# 3. Headers (Optional but useful for security)
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
